## Install

Prerequisites: This tool was only tested under Ubuntu 19.04 (shoul also work under 18.04). You also need to have at least Go 1.12.x installed.

1. Git clone the [RocksDB repository](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb)
2. Go into the newly cloned directory and checkout branch `5.17.fb`
3. Install needed dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libzstd-dev liblz4-dev`
4. Compile the RocksDB shared libs and install them at the appropriate location via: `make shared_lib && make install-shared`
5. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`
6. Git clone **this** repository into another directory
7. Get the RocksDB Go wrapper via (replace `/path/to/rocksdb/include` and `/path/to/rocksdb` with the correct paths; 
under Ubuntu 19.04, this might be: `/usr/local/include/rocksdb` and `/usr/local/lib`): 
    ```
    CGO_CFLAGS="-I/path/to/rocksdb/include" \
    CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/rocksdb -lrocksdb -lstdc++ -lm -lz -lbz2 -lsnappy -llz4 -lzstd" \
      go get github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb
    ```
9. Compile the program using `go build`; if there's no output it means the program has been successfully compiled

## Usage

### Generating a localsnapshots-db from local snapshot files and a spent-addresses-db

Given the above flags, the program per default expects local snapshot files prefixed with "mainnet." and a `spent-addresses-db` in the same folder.
Running the program **without** any argument yields per default a `localsnapshots-db` folder containing RocksDB database data:
```
$ ./iri-ls-sa-merger
reading and writing spent addresses database
persisted 13298777 spent addresses
writing local snapshot data...
ms index/hash/timestamp: 1163676/OX9DIVLRPFNSICOGRTKETSSPXZTTABPZMGS9WXGCLEJOURTFBXPJYMBDGDOZIOCFKHBMJGAHSGLMZ9999/1567592924
solid entry points: 49
seen milestones: 101
ledger entries: 383761
max supply correct: true
bytes size correct: true (21882347 = 21882347)
```

#### Print local snapshot infos
Using `./iri-ls-sa-merger -ls-info` yields information about the local snapshot files:
```
$ ./iri-ls-sa-merger -ls-info
ms index/hash/timestamp: 1163676/OX9DIVLRPFNSICOGRTKETSSPXZTTABPZMGS9WXGCLEJOURTFBXPJYMBDGDOZIOCFKHBMJGAHSGLMZ9999/1567592924
solid entry points: 49
seen milestones: 101
ledger entries: 383761
max supply correct: true
bytes size correct: true (21882347 = 21882347)
```

### Merging multiple spent-addresses sources

Using:
```
$ ./iri-ls-sa-merger -merge-spent-addresses \
-merge-spent-addresses-sources="./spent-addresses-db-1,./spent-addresses-db-2,./previousEpochsSpentAddresses1.txt,./previousEpochsSpentAddresses2.txt,./previousEpochsSpentAddresses3.txt" \
```
Outputs:
```
[merge spent-addresses sources mode]
reading in ./spent-addresses-db-1
new 13298777, known 0 ...done	
reading in ./spent-addresses-db-2
new 17435, known 13298777 ...done	
reading in ./previousEpochsSpentAddresses1.txt
new 0, known 726900 ...done	
reading in ./previousEpochsSpentAddresses2.txt
new 0, known 726871 ...done	
reading in ./previousEpochsSpentAddresses3.txt
new 0, known 996513 ...done	
persisted 13316212 spent addresses
finished, took 5m36.854551752s
```
yields per default a `merged-spent-addresses-db` containing the spent addresses of all specified sources.

### Generating an export file from a localsnapshots-db

Using `./iri-ls-sa-merger -export-db` yields a gzip compressed binary `export.gz.bin` file containing the local snapshot,
ledger state and spent-addresses out of a `localsnapshots-db`. This can be useful for other applications which are reliant on having
the given data in a simple format. You must use different version of the program to read/write different export file versions.

Starting with v4, `./iri-ls-sa-merger -export-db` yields a non-gzipped binary `export.bin` which may not contain any spent addresses
if it was generated using the `-omit-spent-addresses` flag. v4 uses little endianess and no gzip compression.
Using the spent addresses count within the export file allows the importing program to behave accordingly.

**Note that file format v1 and v2 use big endianness, while v3 and 4 uses little endianness.**

Note that there are **no** delimiters between the values (there's no `:`), so use the above byte size notation to simply parse
the values accordingly. You can use the verification method's source code to understand on how to write a function
reading in such file.
